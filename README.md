# 🚀 Stellar Multisig Contract

A smart contract built using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/), written in Rust, enabling deterministic wallet address generation from email strings, safe token transfers, and currency conversion logic with platform fee calculations.

- Deterministic wallet generation via SHA-256 hash of email
- Email → Address mapping (`derive_wallet_address_from_email`)
- Token transfer with balance tracking & logging
- Currency conversion rate computation
- Fee calculation (basis points)
- Input validation for timestamps, balances, and currency support
